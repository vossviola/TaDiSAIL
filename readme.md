TaDiSAIL - Taxonomy of Digital Scholarship Activities in Libraries (v. 0.0.0, 08/2017)
=====================================================================================

This taxonomy of digital scholarship activities in libraries was developed for use by the library community in the development of digital scholarship offices, programs, and initiatives. The taxonomy is expected to be particularly useful to endeavors aiming to chacterize and discuss the intellectual and process-based labor that accompanies this work, to library and campus administrators, in collaboration with researchers, and in making cases in promotion and tenure binders.

TaDiSAIL is usually pronounced "ta-di-sail" and is not a nautical device.

In addition to the current human-readable version of the taxonomy, we are planning to publish machine-readable formats of it.
